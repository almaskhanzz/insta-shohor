            <h3>1. How does JavaScript work?</h3>
            <p class="fs-5 bg-light rounded" style="text-align: justify;">
                JavaScript is a dynamic programming language which is often called by JS. JS is a high lavel programming
                language where the language format is human readable,
                however computer doesn't understand human readable code. Its only understand machine code or binary
                code. Thats why we need browser to run the js. Every browser have JavaScript engines, for example Google
                Chrome has V8, Firefox has Spidermonkey. JavaScript engine handles and runs the code. If we use Chrome
                to run a JavaScript program then the will be received by the browser's engine and the V8 engine will run
                the code to obtain the output. There are some steps that the source code goes throgh and gets executed.
                The first step is called Parser. When we run JavaScript program, the parser receive the code inside the
                JS engine. If the code have syntactic errors, the parser will detect the error and stop execution with
                throwing error. The second step is AST. After checking JS code and if there are no errors then a data
                structure is created which is called AST(Abstract Syntax Tree). The third step is conversion to machine
                code. After creating AST by parser, the JS engine converts the JS code into machine code.
                And the last step is machine code. Once the JS code gets converted in the machine language, the system
                execute the final code.

            <h3>3. What are the Difference between local storage and session storage?</h3>
            <p class="fs-5 bg-light rounded" style="text-align: justify;">
                Local storage and Session storage are near identical with their activities. But there are some
                differences between them. Local storage read-only property of the window interface allows us to access a
                storage object for the Documents's origin whereas the session storage read-only property accesses a
                session Storage object for the current origin.Local storage capacity is higher than session storage
                where local storage have
                10MB and session storage have 5MB. Local storage can be accessed from any window for example, the stored
                data of loacal storage can be used from multiple windows whereas session storage
                cannot be accessed from any windows, it can only be accessed from the same tab. Once the data is stored
                in
                local storage then there is no expiration time
                for local storage until it gets
                removed from the browser, on the other hand session storage has expiration time for eaxmple, by closing
                the browser tab the session storage gets expired.
